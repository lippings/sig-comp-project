# sig-comp-project
Project work for a signal compression course.

The project work involves reading an image Image_X.png and compressing a block of that image with Golomb-Rice encoding, blockwise Golomb-Rice encoding and Huffman encoding (Huffman uses builtin functions).

`main.mlx` uses all implemented methods one by one and compares the compressed size with standard image codecs.
